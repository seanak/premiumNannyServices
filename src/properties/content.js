          'Natia was our nanny in Tbilisi back when our daughter was born in July 2019. She helped us so much looking after our daughter whilst we dashed around to various offices/halls to organise various documents to enable us to apply for our little girls passport. We did not speak the language & it was such a help taking Natia with us when we needed help so she could translate for us. Her spoken English is fantastic. She also stayed with us a little longer helping us part-time when we had a bit of time to ourselves. She was so patient, kind & caring & our daughter loved her. We were in Georgia for almost 6 months. We would highly recommend Natia to any new parent.',

          'Premium Nanny Service is highly professional and only has the most experienced, knowledgeable and trust worthy nannies. We were delighted with our nanny who helped us with our first child and then we used her again to help with our newborn twins. She is now considered part of our family. She was fantastic and extremely hard working - she helped in the day and also did some nights. She adapted to fit around our schedule and that of the babies and helped a lot with feeding issues and winding. We felt completely comfortable leaving her in sole care of our children when we were out during the day or getting some much needed sleep at night! Would highly recommend and happy to speak with anyone considering International Nanny Service 🙂',

          'I would highly recommend the services of Miss Natela Kintsurashvilli. While we were in Georgia, Natia, as we called her, was the live-in nanny for our newborn baby daughter Therese. She was an immeasurable help and source of support for me as a first time mum. She would wake up with Therese every two hours to attend to her needs. Therese is a colic baby and difficult to settle. Natia was my angel assisting me in every way possible and showing me how to care for Therese. She would also bathe her, wash her clothes and keep her nursery in great order. During the day, when Therese was asleep, Natia would cook for us and on occasion treat us to her delicious pancakes. Natia also was great help when we took baby Therese on outings. She would make sure baby Therese is well covered and protected from the elements. Natia was very thorough in following the Dr. recommendations, she would never fail to expose Therese to the sunlight as recommended by our pediatrician. Also Miss Kintsurashvilli is fluent in English and we found her to be a great interpreter. On the day we were leaving Georgia, Natia came with us to the airport and stayed till we checked in. Our departure was quite emotional. I would very much recommend Miss Kintsurashvilli services to anyone looking for quality nanny. She is an incredibly diligent, responsible and caring person.',
